# PCA Analysis for Anaerobic Digesters

## Overview

This repository contains code for performing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on data related to anaerobic digesters. PCA is a statistical technique used to simplify data sets, reducing the number of variables while preserving the essential information. In the context of anaerobic digesters, PCA can be valuable for understanding the relationships between different parameters and identifying key factors influencing their performance.

## Contents

data/: This directory contains sample data sets related to anaerobic digesters. These data sets are used for demonstration purposes in the PCA analysis.
PCA_Analysis.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for conducting PCA analysis on the provided data sets. It includes step-by-step explanations and visualizations to help understand the PCA process.
requirements.txt: This file lists all Python dependencies required to run the code. You can install these dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Getting Started

## To run the PCA analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PCA_Anaerobic_Digesters.git.
Navigate to the cloned directory: cd PCA_Anaerobic_Digesters.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter Notebook PCA_Analysis.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the data sets and execute the PCA analysis.
Data

The sample data sets provided in the data/ directory contain various parameters relevant to anaerobic digesters, such as temperature, pH, substrate concentration, gas production rate, etc. These data sets are synthetic and intended for demonstration purposes. For real-world applications, you should replace them with your own data.

## Results

The PCA analysis will generate visualizations and insights into the relationships between different variables in the anaerobic digester data. These results can help in identifying influential factors, detecting patterns, and making informed decisions to optimize digester performance.
